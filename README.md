# Propel Technical Interview

## Goals
This is currently a fully functioning spring boot application. In our interview we will ask you to write a set of tests so that the "StudentService.java" class is 100% covered. You can download and play with said test using your favourite development suite. We are interested in what problems, choices and decisions you make while creating those tests.

Remember our values of Owners Mindset, Quality, Forthright conversations, Impact and Client Obsession.
